This is ninjastorms "NinjaStorms"
==============================

NinjaStorms is an attempt to create a simple RealTime Operating System which
is currently running on Lego Mindstorms EV3 and a virtualized environment.

Building from Source:

  ninjastorms uses (mostly) standard autotools to manage the build process.
  to configure the sources, you need to execute the configure script. If you
  checked out the sources from the repository, or there is no configure script
  present for any other reason, you can generate it by executing

    $> ./autogen.sh

  To configure the project, execute

    $> ./configure --host=<host> BOARD=<board>

  where <host> is the appropriate host triplet for the target architecture,
  for example arm-none-eabi for the EV3 or the qemu environments and <board>
  is a supported board - see Supported Boards.

  This step requires a <host> prefixed toolchain capable of generating
  executables for your target architecture. To generate a <host> prefixed
  toolchain, in case your distribution does not provide one, execute

    $> TARGET=<host> ./tools/build_toolchain.sh

  Correct host values for the several boards are listed in Supported Boards.

  Assuming a working toolchain for your architecture and a configured source
  tree, the project is built by executing

    $> make

  When the build completes, the kernel binary can be found in the source tree
  as a file named `ninjastorms`.

Deployment:

  A built kernel is deployed to the target architecture by executing

    $> make deploy

  Watch out for permission issues when deploying. See Supported Boards for
  details on the deployment processes for different board configurations.

Further Reading:

  The kernel entry point is the kernel_main function in kernel/main.c - this
  should be a good place to start reading into the sorce code.

  We also collected information on the different supported boards in the docs/
  directory of the source tree.

  Additional documentation can be found in our github wiki:
